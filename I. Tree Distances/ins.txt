You are given a tree consisting of n nodes.

Your task is to determine for each node the maximum distance to another node.

Input:
The first line contains an integer n: the number of nodes, which are numbered 1,2,…,n.

Then there are n−1 lines describing the edges. Each line contains two integers a and b, indicating an edge between nodes a and b.

Output:
Print n integers: for each node 1,2,…,n, the maximum distance to another node.
